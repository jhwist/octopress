Hi, my name is Henrik. I'm a Software Guy by trade and recently (in 2010) started to ride my 
[bike](/blog/categories/riding) again. And then winter came along and I wanted
to stay fit. Therefore I started to [run](/blog/categories/running) again.

While riding or running I let my mind wander and noticed a desire to write stuff down. That's what this blog
is for. I hope I can provide amusing stories, sprinkled with some useful information and the occasional
product recommendation.

My other passion is writing code. Even if I don't have nearly as much opportunity to write code every day
due to my management-style position, I still need a place to write about my findings and code-adventures. That
would be the [co.de](/blog/categories/coding/) part of the blog.

For a somewhat longer story as to why I "started" running and riding again, I recommend to 
read my [introduction](/blog/2013/04/09/running-on-my-old-stomping-ground/).
