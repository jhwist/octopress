Hi, thanks for checking my [Strava](http://www.strava.com/athletes/104888) profile.

My name is Henrik, I'm a Software Guy by trade and recently (in 2010) started to ride my 
[bike](/blog/categories/riding) again. And then winter came along and I wanted
to stay fit. Therefore I started to [run](/blog/categories/running) again.

While riding or running I let my mind wander and noticed a desire to write
stuff down. That's what this blog is for. I hope I can provide amusing stories,
sprinkled with some useful information and the occasional
product recommendation.

My other passion is writing code. Even if I don't have nearly as much opportunity to write code every day
due to my management-style position, I still need a place to write about my findings and code-adventures. That
would be the [co.de](/blog/categories/coding/) part of the blog.

For a somewhat longer story as to why I "started" running and riding again, I recommend to 
read my [introduction](/blog/2013/04/09/running-on-my-old-stomping-ground/).

If you want to stay in touch with me, I recommend to
[follow me](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A4000%2Fabout%2Ftwitter%2F&region=follow_link&screen_name=runbikecode&tw_p=followbutton&variant=2.0)
on Twitter, add my blog to your [RSS Feed reader](http://feeds.feedburner.com/RunBikeCode)
or subscribe to my Newsletter.

Again, thanks for checking this site out; for the latest post, you might
want to head over to the [home page](/), or, since you are coming from Strava,
head over to the [Race Reports](/races/)!
