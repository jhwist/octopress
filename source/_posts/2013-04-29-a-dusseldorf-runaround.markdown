> While my life is nowhere near as busy{% fn_ref 1 %} as Ray Maker's of [DC Rainmaker

I spent Tuesday to Thursday of last week in D&uuml;sseldorf for a conference on [quality 
assurance](http://www.iqnite-conferences.com/de/index.aspx). Since I arrived
late on Monday evening and had a bit of time to spare on Tuesday morning I decided
to get my legs moving and explore the city and its surrounding with my running shoes.

Having only little experience with running in foreign cities I asked the very friendly
receptionist for running routes. On hindsight I should have just checked Strava
for popular segments around downtown D&uuml;sseldorf and would have found pretty much 
the same route she recommended.

So out of the hotel I went and right across the river Rhine. The weather was overcast
(whereas we had blue sky on Wednesday and Thursday, both of which I spent indoors ...)
so all the photo opportunities presented themselves rather gray.

On the other side of the river I turned upstream towards the Rheinknie-Bridge 
on a nice and flat path for cyclists and pedestrians. Not much traffic on a Tuesday
morning except for the occasional runner exchanging nods as a greeting.

After a brief stop to capture these ancient lawn-mowers I crossed the river again,
making my way towards the city. Since I didn't know how many traffic lights my 
path would cross if I'd go right into downtown, I decided to stay at the river
and head back towards the hotel.

I found myself back at the bridge where I initially started the run and was still missing
a good 3km for my planned 13km run, so I took the opportunity to run around the nearby "Rheinpark",
not knowing that

  1. The path around the park is exactly 3km long (perfect!)
  2. The path around the park is a local [Strava Segment](http://app.strava.com/segments/1376507) (sorry, guys!)

Trusting my instinct to find the way back to the hotel I wrapped up my morning run
with [13.3km in 1h12'](http://app.strava.com/activities/50757628/overview), covering this route:
