It seems my body can cope really well with heat, I don't easily get sunburned
and prefer a hot summer day without clouds in the sky over a warm albeit grey
day any time. Therefore I really enjoy riding my bike in the hotness of the day,
when the headwind feels like it's coming from a hairdryer.

Just this week, though, there was no way to leave early or take a day off for a
good long ride. Instead I'll spend the days at work until the better part of the
evening (at least it's for a good reason). So what's one to do? Do a quick
ride in the evening, just before sunset. There was only a little over an hour
of daylight left (no lights on the bike, have to be home before dusk), so I did
my short 35km course of choice. Took it easy (except for one segment) and enjoyed
the ride. I even stopped to take some pictures.

Here's my beauty, which I have yet to introduce to you, along with all the other
gear I use for running and cycling.

Certainly these pictures make up for the missed hot afternoon ride! Here are
all the details, Strava-wise:
