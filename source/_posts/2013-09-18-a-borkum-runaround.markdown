Long runs on vacation tend not to be very family compatible if done at normal hours,
because they naturally take away a good chunk of a day. For that reason my alarm
was set to 6.15am with the plan to run from 7am to roughly 9am and be back in time
for breakfast. Scrambling out of the van without trying to wake up everyone else
I was greeted with this view:

After a quick bite to eat I put on my running clothes and shoes, and set
off, taking a right out from the campground that we called our home base for
the week. Headed north-east I followed the street to the airfield (no planes
taking off this early) and switched to a smaller path that would take me
out to the north-east corner of the island.

As you will see in the overall route below I wasn't able to reach the furthest
north-east corner of the island, simply because Borkum is for the most part one
giant nature reserve with only small trails going out to the remote areas. Also,
I'd have to run on soft sand, because there is a lot of sand on the edges of this
island. So I stayed on the paved path turning all the way to the east, passing
a lot of interesting items, such as:

And of course some wild-life like these little fellas. Believe me, there were
quite a lot of them; there was hardly ever a stretch without them. Some more
shy than others, especially in the remote areas where not so many people come
past during the day.
Of course a couple of sheep where spotted happily taking their breakfast, only
looking up very briefly to see who was coming along. They didn't really care.
Who's to blame them at 7.30am?

## Gone with the wind ##

Now, this long run wasn't merely planned as a steady state run but had two
higher effort sections (15 minutes high Z2, 10 minutes low Z3) embedded. Given
the direction of the wind for this day (actually most of the days we spent there)
you'll see why I chose to do the first effort after turning south-west again.

You can see from the corresponding pace graph (exported from TrainingPeaks) that
I did in fact start the first tempo segment right around kilometer 7.5, shortly
after heading onto the dike. Heartrate-wise I could have gone faster (because
of the strong tail-wind), but the pavement on the dike was rather uneven and
I certainly didn't want to trip and fall. No fun in doing that.

As mentioned before, Borkum is part of a large nature reserve and the stretch
east of the dike belongs to the large [Wadden Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Saxony_Wadden_Sea_National_Park),
which is listed on the world heritage list by UNESCO. At this time of the day there
was a low tide, so I had a good view of the [salt marsh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_marsh).

After going all the way back south-west bound, I crossed the road and rail tracks
that lead to the harbour. This is a boring 4km out and back which I skipped as I
didn't want to end up with more than 20km for this run.

Onwards, then, to the southernmost point of the run. After running about a mile
on a beautiful trail through the woods I found myself confronted with this stuff
pictured on the right.

Clearly a planning error on my part (even though without it I would have cut
the runaround rather not so round) so for the next half mile or so I had to
suck it up and run in the deep sand before reaching the next dike which would
bring me back to town.

  
## Back in town ##

Finishing my second higher effort section right after(!) coming down from that
dike I turned towards the town *Borkum* and meandered through small streets, passing
the old lighthouse, a very old graveyard and this particularly interesting fence:

{% imgcap http://assets.runbikeco.de/borkum-whale-fence.png %}

It's not immediately obvious, but the house that this fence belongs to was inhabited
by a whaler (way back when whaling was still allowed and pretty common in that area).
Once you strip a whale of all the meat and edible stuff you are left with a bunch
of bones. So the whaler used the jaw-bones of whales to build the fence. Pretty sturdy
it seems.

{% imgcap http://assets.runbikeco.de/borkum-train.png No, not an actual CafÃ© on board %}

As mentioned, Borkum has exactly one rail track with a train that goes out and
back between downtown and the harbour a couple of times a day. On this Sunday
morning the train was waiting for the first passengers to board.

{% img right http://assets.runbikeco.de/borkum-lighthouse.png Lighthouse %} Of 
course I wanted to get a good look at the waterfront on the other side of the
island, so I took a turn around the new lighthouse, which itself is quite
impressive. We would actually climb all the way up there a couple of days later,
enjoying(?) 391 stairs to the top. But the view, as you can imagine, was well
worth it.

I started my cool-down along the waterfront, where I finally got to see other
people again, mostly other runners but also many locals walking their dogs.
Still, the beach and the beach chairs were pretty empty at 8.30am.  Believe me,
though, it would get busy as the day went on.

Turning away from the waterfront again I had little over a kilometer to come
back to the camp ground, finishing the run with 19.1km in 1h47m. My plan to be
back in time for a family breakfast worked out pretty nicely, so no family vacation
time was lost and we enjoyed a beautiful albeit windy day on the island.
