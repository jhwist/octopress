Long runs on vacation tend not to be very family compatible if done at normal hours,
because they naturally take away a good chunk of a day. For that reason my alarm
was set to 6.15am with the plan to run from 7am to roughly 9am and be back in time
for breakfast.

 * 6.15am wakeup w/ pic
 * bunnies
 * sheep
 * draw wind direction into map

kinda trumps this, but his doesn't have the sheep qualifier:
