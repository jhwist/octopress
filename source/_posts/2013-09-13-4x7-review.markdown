## As seen on runbikeco.de

As you might have guessed if you follow me along on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/runbikecode)
or [Strava](http://www.strava.com/athletes/104888) I was on vacation for the most
part of the last four weeks. No blogging has happened, but you will be able to
read about my Borkum Runaround soon!

## Notable past training

Despite being on vacation, I managed to get a couple of good runs in. I'm
especially proud of two long runs of about 20km that I made myself wake up
at 6am for. Also, as luck would have it, I found a nearby track on one of our
stop-overs and was able to do an early morning workout with mile-repeats.

## Upcoming training

My next race is a half-marathon (my second!) on September 22, which means I'll
be tapering for the next few days. I'm also nursing some slight knee pain (left
knee this time, wth), and I hope to get rid of that before the race.

## Food consumed
I won't bore you with everything I ate during the past four weeks, but there is
always a meal or two that was special.

 * Fish. While being on the vacation at Germany's North-Sea coast, I ate fish. Lots of fish. And it was good. So good that I forgot to take pictures of it.

## Found elsewhere
Lastly, a more or less uncommented link-dump of the past 28 days.

 * [Woman steals own bike back](http://www.grindtv.com/outdoor/excursions/post/woman-steals-own-bike-back-from-thief/)

Yep, not a lot of internet browsing. Heck, it's called vacation, after all. I yet
have to catch up with my feedreader.
