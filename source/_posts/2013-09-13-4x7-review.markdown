> I stumble over quite a lot of interesting articles and some are worth sharing on this site. I plan to do this every 4 weeks (thus "4x7 Review") and I will include my own posts, some training highlights and some of my nutrition. Enjoy!

## As seen on runbikeco.de

## Notable past training

## Upcoming training

## Food consumed
I won't bore you with everything I ate during the past four weeks, but there is always a meal or two that was special.

 * Fish. While being on the vacation at Germany's North-Sea coast, I ate fish. Lots of fish. And it was good. So good that I forgot to take pictures of it.

## Found elsewhere
Lastly, a more or less uncommented link-dump of the past 28 days.

 * [Woman steals own bike back](http://www.grindtv.com/outdoor/excursions/post/woman-steals-own-bike-back-from-thief/)
