## As seen on runbikeco.de
 
It's been a busy four weeks blogging-wise:

 * The race that didn't happen: My [Tegernseelauf](/blog/2013/09/16/race-report-tegernseelauf/) race report.
 * Took a while to complete this one, but here is my [Borkum Runaround](/blog/2013/09/18/a-borkum-runaround/).
 * Race report: [Hapfelmeier Laufcup](/blog/2013/09/26/race-report-hapfelmeier-laufcup/).
 * One more race: [Baltimore Running Festival](/blog/2013/09/30/one-more-race-baltimore-running-festival/).
 * Breakfast for champions: My [Fuel for a long run](/blog/2013/10/04/breakfast-for-champions-or-a-long-run/).

## Notable past training

In between tapering for my fall
[half-marathon](/blog/2013/09/26/race-report-hapfelmeier-laufcup/) and
preparing for my unplanned end-of-season [half-marathon](/blog/2013/09/30/one-more-race-baltimore-running-festival/)
there wasn't much notable training to report on.

## Upcoming training

I'll be taking two weeks off of running and will be focusing on strength and
mobility. Beginning November I'll start to build the base for a successful next
year.

## Found elsewhere
Lastly, a more or less uncommented link-dump of the past 28 days.

 * This should have been in the last review already, but somehow I failed to mention it: Strava recently added [personal heat maps](http://blog.strava.com/new-premium-feature-personal-heatmaps-6719/) as a premium feature. Cool stuff!
 * Garmin recently announced their new [620/220 running watches](http://sites.garmin.com/forerunnerCoach/). Pretty cool stuff (USB + WiFi, finally!). Head over to Ray's blog for a quick [first look](http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2013/09/garmins-running-watches.html)
 * Want to get around in Moscow? Get your [running shoes out](http://www.runnersworld.com/general-interest/moscow-marathon-winner-could-have-outrun-traffic), leave the car in the garage!
 * New Marathon world record in Berlin! [Wilson Kipsang](http://www.iaaf.org/news/report/wilson-kipsang-sets-world-record-of-20323-in) runs 2:03:23.
 * And speaking of marathon times, here are the [Boston Marathon Acceptances](http://www.baa.org/news-and-press/news-listing/2013/september/2014-boston-marathon-qualifier-acceptances.aspx) complete with the respective qualifying times. 
 * TrainingPeaks, the main training log software I use, get's a new look with [lots of new technology under the hood](http://blog.trainingpeaks.com/posts/2013/10/1/gears-thoughts-we-have-ignition.html). Currently in beta, can't wait for the final release!
