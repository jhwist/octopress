> I stumble over quite a lot of interesting articles and some are worth sharing on this site. I plan to do this every 4 weeks (thus "4x7 Review") and I will include my own posts, some training highlights and some of my nutrition. Enjoy!

## As seen on runbikeco.de

## Notable past training

## Upcoming training

## Food consumed
I won't bore you with everything I ate during the past four weeks, but there is always a meal or two that was special.

 * Whole BBQ chicken (with pic!)
 * Guacamole Burgers
 * Gallettes

## Found elsewhere
Lastly, a more or less uncommented link-dump of the past 28 days.

* Mark Sisson on the [necessity of a good night's sleep](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/how-to-get-fitter-faster-and-stronger-with-quality-sleep/#axzz2SEkOcuBK)
* I've had my share of injuries this year already, so this article resonates very well with me and might be of help for any future mishaps. [The psychology of being sidelined](http://psychologywod.com/2013/05/19/coping-with-injury-the-psychology-of-being-sidelined/)
* How to become a [serial race](http://www.runnersworld.com/elite-runners/frequent-flyer?page=single) ... not that I have any plans in that direction. Interesting read, though.
* Not sure if this is really legit or not, but CyclingTips has a blog-column called [The Secret Pro](http://cyclingtips.com.au/2012/12/the-secret-pro/)  where a high profile World Tour rider has agreed to speak his mind, while remaining completely anonymous.
* [How and Why Should You Strengthen Your Hip Abductors](http://runnersconnect.net/running-training-articles/hip-strengthening-for-runners). Yep, run training consists of more than just running. Doh.
* [Don't mess with marathon runners](http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/mugger-caught-after-being-chased-through-cork-by-man-training-for-marathon-232156.html)

> With that, have a great four weeks ahead. And remember, you can subscribe to this blog via Atom as well as Feedburner.
