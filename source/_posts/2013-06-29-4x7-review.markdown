## As seen on runbikeco.de
Looks I have been slacking a lot during the last four weeks. There is only
one post to report on and that was my [quick evening ride](/blog/2013/06/19/quick-evening-ride/).
Let's see if July is a better month for blogging again.

Also, apologies for this review being one day late. Had to watch Star Wars
Episode III with my boy last night.

## Notable past training
I had a solid four weeks of run training and I was able to mostly follow my Coach's
plan.  I did substitute one planned long run with a [long bike ride](http://app.strava.com/activities/60686828),
but also had a good [20km long run](http://app.strava.com/activities/62375282), going that distance for
the first time since my half marathon in April.

All in all: Ran 160km in 15h33' with a maximum distance of 20.2km. I'm getting
used to hill repeats (it's actually pretty difficult to find a suitable hill
around here), did some mile repeats and two 30 minute time trials (finished
the first with 6.58km in 30' and the second in 7.02km in 30').

On the bike I clocked in at 249km (that's less than in May) with the longest
ride being 102km. I had hoped to get another ride in this week to at least make
it to 300km, but it was raining for the most part of the week, so no riding
here.

## Upcoming training
My July run training plan will have me run 47km, 47km, 61km and 32km per week,
which should leave me with 187km of running awesomeness. Some highlights include
mile repeats (4x1mi, 5x1mi), hill repeats (12x2' hills), a 22km long run (that's going
to be fun, my longest run ever) and a couple of fast sessions with sprints.

Also, I'll be running a 10.3km race on July 14th, the "Run 4 Trees", a
local charity race. Since that is the day for another long run, my coach
had the brilliant idea to run another 10k as a cool down right afterwards. It
will be interesting to see how the second 10k feel.

## Food consumed
I won't bore you with everything I ate during the past four weeks, but there is
always a meal or two that was special.

 * I stumbled across this [Avocado egg recipe](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tim-ferriss/eggocado_b_3328506.html) by
  Tim Ferris and prepared it twice already. They are super easy to make
  and taste awesome. Plus: Fat + Protein galore!
 * Without pictures (forgot to take one, plus I prepared better looking ones already), a
  Bavarian Schweinebraten (pig roast) was had a few weeks ago. While the roast turned
  out really well, I messed up the gravy completely. My wife came to the rescue reminding
  me that there was some gravy in the freezer. Yay!

And then tomorrow I'll have a BBQ for a couple of friends and as time is
limited for preparations tomorrow, I decided to prepare [Fatty's famous brats](http://www.fatcyclist.com/2012/05/03/how-to-prepare-bratwurst/).


## Found elsewhere
Lastly, a more or less uncommented link-dump of the past 28 days.

 * [Speed Workout: Standing Rest vs. Jogging Rest](http://running.competitor.com/2013/05/training/speed-workouts-standing-rest-vs-jogging-rest_73953)
 * [An Immodest Proposal for Doping Closure](http://bicycling.com/blogs/theselection/2013/06/07/an-immodest-proposal-for-doping-closure/) with Lance Armstrong [agreeing](https://twitter.com/lancearmstrong/status/343137862910353409) like ... immediately.
 * On a lighter note: [To wave or not to wave](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323566804578551733633353690.html?mod=e2tw). I'm all pro-wave, but only wave to like-minded, i.e. I'd not wave to the casual bike rider (without helmet, no less) when out on my road bike.
 * Christoph Strasse won the Race Across America (RAAM) in a record breaking [7 d 22 h 52 m](http://www.raceacrossamerica.org/raam/rcracer.php?s_N_category_group=1&s_N_Race_ID=1&s_N_Entry_ID=2949&s_N_Year_ID=37); he's the first winner to finish in under 8 days.
 * CycleOps rebrands to [PowerTap](http://www.powertap.com/blogs/news/8121647-our-promise-to-you-tested-trusted-true). I own a PowerTab hub and can really relate to the confusion between the company ("CycleOps") and the product ("PowerTap"). So this is a good move, in my eyes.
 * Old, but new to me, [a couple of shoe lacing techniques](http://katierunsthis.com/2011/10/04/running-shoe-lacing-techniques/).
