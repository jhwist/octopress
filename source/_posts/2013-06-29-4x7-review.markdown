> I stumble over quite a lot of interesting articles and some are worth sharing on this site. I plan to do this every 4 weeks (thus "4x7 Review") and I will include my own posts, some training highlights and some of my nutrition. Enjoy!

## As seen on runbikeco.de

## Notable past training

## Upcoming training

## Food consumed
I won't bore you with everything I ate during the past four weeks, but there is always a meal or two that was special.
 
* Avocado eggs (Tim Ferris)
* Schweinebraten

## Found elsewhere
Lastly, a more or less uncommented link-dump of the past 28 days.

 * [Speed Workout: Standing Rest vs. Jogging Rest](http://running.competitor.com/2013/05/training/speed-workouts-standing-rest-vs-jogging-rest_73953)
 * [An Immodest Proposal for Doping Closure](http://bicycling.com/blogs/theselection/2013/06/07/an-immodest-proposal-for-doping-closure/) with Lance Armstrong [agreeing](https://twitter.com/lancearmstrong/status/343137862910353409) like ... immediately.
* On a lighter note: [To wave or not to wave](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323566804578551733633353690.html?mod=e2tw). I'm all pro-wave, but only wave to like-minded, i.e. I'd not wave to the casual bike rider (without helmet, no less) when out on my road bike.
* Christoph Strasse one the Race Across America (RAAM) in a record breaking [7 d 22 h 52 m](http://www.raceacrossamerica.org/raam/rcracer.php?s_N_category_group=1&s_N_Race_ID=1&s_N_Entry_ID=2949&s_N_Year_ID=37); he's the first winner to finish in under 8 days. 
* CycleOps rebrands to [PowerTap](http://www.powertap.com/blogs/news/8121647-our-promise-to-you-tested-trusted-true). I own a PowerTab hub and can really relate to the confusion between the company ("CycleOps") and the product ("PowerTap"). So this is a good move, in my eyes.
* Old, but new to me, [a couple of shoe lacing techniques](http://katierunsthis.com/2011/10/04/running-shoe-lacing-techniques/).

> With that, have a great four weeks ahead. And remember, you can subscribe to this blog via Atom as well as Feedburner.
