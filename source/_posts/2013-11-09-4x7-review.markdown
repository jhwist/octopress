> I stumble over quite a lot of interesting articles and some are worth sharing on this site. I plan to do this every 4 weeks (thus "4x7 Review") and I will include my own posts, some training highlights and some of my nutrition. Enjoy!

## As seen on runbikeco.de
 * A trip to the U.S. - as seen by my [Withings Pulse](/blog/2013/10/18/a-trip-to-the-us-as-seen-by-my-withings-pulse/).
 * My race report of the [Baltimore Running Festival half-marathon](http://blog.runbikeco.de/blog/2013/10/21/race-report-baltimore-running-festival-half-marathon/).


## Notable past training

## Upcoming training

## Food consumed
I won't bore you with everything I ate during the past four weeks, but there is always a meal or two that was special.

 * Having spent a weekend in Baltimore I had to try some crab cake. It was delicious.
 * Also, as we don't have a [Five Guys](http://www.fiveguys.com/) place in Germany, I took advantage of that as well while staying in Baltimore.

## Found elsewhere
Lastly, a more or less uncommented link-dump of the past 28 days.

 * TrainingPeaks looks a the [Power Data from Kona](http://blog.trainingpeaks.com/posts/2013/10/15/power-data-from-kona-2013.html)
 * Chris Horner (winner of the '13 Vuelta) publishes his [biological UCI passport](http://www.chrishornerracing.com/13-uci-passport/). Just to have it backfire, when an [M.D. looks at it](http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/biking/road-biking/Chris-Horner-Bio-Passport-Raises-Doubts.html).
 * Something coding related: J.B. Rainsberger writes about [The Pain of Implicit Dependencies](http://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/2013/10/14/the-pain-of-implicit-dependencies/). Well worth the read, especially since it deals with [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), the blogging platform I use myself.
