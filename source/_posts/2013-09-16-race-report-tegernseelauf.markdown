I registered for this run on April 02, 2013, even before I completed my first
[half-marathon](/blog/2013/04/17/vienna-city-half-marathon/). Talk about being confident for this distance. I knew it would
sell out eventually and didn't want to test my chances. Upon receiving the
confirmation email I put the date into the calendar and didn't worry about it
until much later. During summer, the weekends around the planned race date
filled up quickly and I was happy to see that September 22nd was still good to
go.

## Packet pickup ##
When I registered I didn't know for sure if I would make it in time for a personal
pick up of the race packet, so I opted to have it sent to me. Last week of summer holidays
comes around and I receive a rather fat envelope, in it all the important stuff: Bib number
with timing chips, finisher t-shirt(!), promotional stuff and important information for
the race day.

## Planning ahead ##
As the start of the race would be at 10am and the drive to Tegernsee can be pretty crowded
I had the brilliant idea to head out on Saturday, do a short run to scout a particular
part of the course and then camp in the van, making it for a relaxed start into the race
day. I even contacted the organizers by email to check for available parking lots. Got an
"all clear" back.

## One week to go ##
Ah, it was all lined up so perfectly: Kid's birthday the week before the race,
celebrating in a small mountain hut, far away from civilization, having a good time.
Come back on Sunday evening, glancing over the Facebook timeline ...
> Nice. Ran this as a fast training run.

Ah, a friend of mine did her long run on the HM course in Tegernsee, nice indeed.

> Looking forward to next week in Bad TÃ¶lz.

Wait, what? You're supposed to run Tegernsee next week, what are you talking about?
Hmmm. There is a link to race results ... for the Tegernsee half-marathon ... as of *today*?

Runs upstairs, grabs athlete information from the race packet, reads details "... September 15, 2013 ..."
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU...

Turns out I put the race on the wrong weekend. Tegernsee half-marathon took place
on September 15, 2013 while I had a good time in the mountains. The one thing
that makes the missed race easier to cope with is the fact that it was pouring
rain as far as I can tell from the pictures.

## DNS ##
So, that was my first did-not-start, and one with one of the stupidest reasons ever.
Right now I'm looking at alternatives to race a half-marathon next weekend, luckily
I have three options. I'll let you know what I decided for and hopefully write a
real race report next week!
