I usually try not to talk too much about my goals before a race, because I quite
often set very ambitious goals which leads to people either not believing me in 
the first place or mocking me if I fail to attain the goal. I've long since decided
to only give vague answers to the question "_What time to you want to run on race XY?_"
and then surprise people (and quite often myself) while still leaving room for 
bad results.

So on Sunday I will debut in running a [Half Marathon](http://www.vienna-marathon.com/)
in Vienna. Up until two weeks ago I had a very solid training, mostly nailing
my workouts of the training plan. Being the ambitious amateur runner, I trained
for a sub 1h 40min time (that's an average of 4'44" per km or 7'28" per mile).
So there you have it, my goal is to run a sub 1h 40min Half Marathon.{% fn_ref 1 %}

### When life gives you lemons ###
As I've mentioned before, on my last real long run I strained a muscle in my
right leg. Being all the "_it's going to be o.k._" guy, I went for two more 
training sessions - mostly ignoring the pain - before giving in and resting. I even saw 
a physiotherapist three times in the last 10 days. Needless to say that this
unplanned rest had a negative effect - if only in my head. As of [today](http://app.strava.com/activities/48335356)
I'm still far from being pain free, but I will give it my best on Sunday. But how
should I run?

### The Strategy ###
It is obvious that I will not be able to run 4'44"/km right from the start. There
are over 30000 people registered for the race, so even if the start corrals are really
well organized, there will be a lot of runners out on the course. That's why I
have decided to break the race into 5km blocks.

#### Start - 5km: 26'15" ####
I noticed during today's run that I need quite some time to warm up. Since I 
don't know whether there will be enough room in the corrals / start area to properly 
warm up, this section will have to double as a warm-up.

I want to aim for a 5'15" pace for the first 5 kilometers. This will leave me with 
a debt of 2'30" on my goal time, but will hopefully allow me to get into a 
good rhythm while at the same time not having to dodge a lot of other runners.

#### 5km - 10km: 50'00" ####
Depending on how my legs feel I will see to accelerate to a sub 5' pace for this section,
ideally already hitting the goal pace of 4'44". By kilometer 5 the crowds on the course
should have lightened up to be able to run a faster pace.

#### 10km - 15km: 1h 13'40"  ####
During this section I will pass the 1 hour mark. Ideally I will have run between
12 and 13km after one hour. The plan is to evaluate my legs and fitness at that time
in order to see if I can accelerate some more (mind you, more than half of the 
distance is already done by then) or if I can at least hold my goal pace and
accept the 2'30" debt from the start.

#### 15km - Finish: 1h 36'35"####
If my thigh doesn't bother me too much (probably courtesy of enough adrenaline) 
I will be in All-In mode for this section. Fighting to either hold the pace or
accelerate and make up for the lost time from the beginning of the race.

Well, it's my first race longer than 10km (where the only strategy is: run as fast as
you can from the beginning), so I'm curious how this plays out. I might be pooped
after 10km (then what?), but I'm pretty sure I won't have anything left in the tank
after 21km. Wish me luck!
