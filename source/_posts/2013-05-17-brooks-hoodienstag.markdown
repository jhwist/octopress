Last week I saw this tweet by [@BrooksrunningDE](https://twitter.com/BrooksrunningDE/) in my 
timeline, thankfully retweeted, because I didn't follow BrooksrunningDE (the German twitter account 
for Brooks) at the time.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="align: center;"><p>[ ] Sonnengott[ ] Nachtschwärmer[ ] LaufbandwetzerWelcher dieser Typen bist du?Verlosen einen Hoodie unter allen Antworten <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23Hoodienstag">#Hoodienstag</a></p>&mdash; Brooks Running DE (@BrooksrunningDE) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrooksrunningDE/status/331670782814076929">May 7, 2013</a></blockquote>

I answered{% fn_ref 1 %} and as luck had it, only very few people replied to the tweet. Wednesday comes around and starts off
with an appointment at the dentist's office. Not that most fun thing to do on a Wednesday morning, but necessary once in a while.
Imagine my surprise when I checked my Twitter timeline after walking out of the dentist's office, finding this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Herzlichen Glückwunsch @<a href="https://twitter.com/runbikecode">runbikecode</a> - die <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23Hoodiefee">#Hoodiefee</a> hat dich ausgelost für den Brooks Hoodie am gestrigen <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23Hoodienstag">#Hoodienstag</a>!</p>&mdash; Brooks Running DE (@BrooksrunningDE) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrooksrunningDE/status/332037624078409728">May 8, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

> "You have won!"

A few DMs and one email later all address and size details had been exchanged. With Thursday being a bank holiday
I didn't expect the package to arrive until the new week. When the new week came around I had long forgotten
about it (yes, tell me about a short attention span). But lo and behold, on Wednesday this week I found a
package waiting at home, which contained ...

It fits, it is comfortable and looks good on me. And best: it was totally free! So, thanks, Brooks,
and good luck everyone for all coming [#Hoodienstag](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23hoodienstag).

 {% fn %} sun-god, not that it matters, but that's what I am. I *love* running in the sun.
 {% fn %} The hash-tag is a blend of the German word for tuesday (=Dienstag), which blends nicely(?) with Hoodie.
