In this spirit I invite you to follow along and watch me learn
[Octopress](http://www.octopress.org/ "Octopress") and how to blog with it. I
imagine there will be a bunch of technical articles early on and I hope to
settle to a good mix of posts about running, riding my bike and - of course -
coding.

As my Octopress knowledge expands you'll probably see design changes (and I
might even write about them) as well as more pages (like an Imprint for
example).

With that here's hoping that I continue to blog after the initial backlog of
ideas has been published. I seem to have failed with my [other blog](http://jhwist.tumblr.com "jhwist on tumblr").
