## As seen on runbikeco.de ##
This time I actually managed to get some posts written. I'll later tell you my secret sauce to blogging.

* [My background story](http://blog.runbikeco.de/blog/2013/04/09/running-on-my-old-stomping-ground/)
* [Strategy for a Half Marathon](/blog/2013/04/11/strategy-for-a-half-marathon/)

* [Race Report and a new 10km PR](/blog/2013/05/02/race-report-fruhjahrslauf-asv-dachau-10km/)

Expect more posts about my cycling adventures as well as (finally!) some technical stuff and coding in
the next few weeks!

## Notable past training
After my Half Marathon on April 17th, I struggled to get back into a training rhythm.
I did a couple of recovery runs, managed to get back to pain-free running at last and
mixed in two or three longish (10 - 15km) runs. Then I took it easy again last week in order
to prepare for the 10km race on [May 1st](/blog/2013/05/02/race-report-fruhjahrslauf-asv-dachau-10km/).

## Upcoming training ##
I noticed that I really miss a structured training plan in regards to my running. On the other hand, I've
already more kilometers under my belt during the first four months of this year than I had for the entire
last year. Therefore I think I'll continue to run whenever I feel like it and have time during May and then
apply some training plan for my next 10km race on July 6th. After that I have one more big race coming in September,
my second Half Marathon. I will reuse the same training plan that I had in place for Vienna and this time I
will see to stay healthy throughout the whole period.

While I'm not taking the month of May completely off of running, I will try to focus on building some base
on the bike - weather permitting.

## Food consumed ##
I won't bore you with everything I ate during the past four weeks, but there is always a meal or two that was special.


* Early April the weather allowed for some outside BBQ (not that I'm picky about the weather, it's just more fun if the
  weather cooperates). I did a Flank Steak BBQ similar to [this one](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/grilled_marinated_flank_steak/).

* [Greek Meatza](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/greek-meatza-with-creamy-feta-kalamata-olives-and-red-onion/), very easy to prepare, delicious and low-carb.
* Then, lastly (without picture), I finally went to eat at the [Burger House](http://www.theburgerhouse.com/) in Munich.
Great choice of Burgers, they even offer them no-carb style (at least if you ask). Good stuff, definitely worth a visit.

## Found elsewhere
Finally, a more or less uncommented link-dump of the past 28 days (yes, it is a weird mix!).

* [Getting the callstack of a running ruby process](http://rrn.dk/running-ruby-process-callstack).
* And some more coding: [5 useful tips for a better commit message](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/48933156625/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message) by the fine folks of Thoughbot.
* A nice piece on getting things started: [The McDonald's Theorem](https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/9216e1c9da7d). Much less about food than the title implies.
* Joe Friel put up sort of a landing page around the topic of [Tapering and Peaking](http://www.joefrielsblog.com/2013/04/tapering-and-peaking-review.html).
* If I read the abstract of this [Foot Strike Patterns](http://journals.humankinetics.com/ijspp-current-issue/ijspp-volume-8-issue-3-may/foot-strike-pattern-and-performance-in-a-marathon) paper correctly it seems that forefoot striking can yield higher performance.
* Read this piece about the [people who watch marathons](http://jezebel.com/the-people-who-watch-marathons-473405924) just after the Boston Marathon attack.

  > "If anyone thought this attack would discourage the runners or the watchers, they've clearly never been to a marathon."

* [TrainingPeaks](http://home.trainingpeaks.com/) (a software that I use and love) is named [official training software of IRONMAN](http://blog.trainingpeaks.com/posts/2013/5/1/trainingpeaks-named-official-training-software-of-ironman.html).
