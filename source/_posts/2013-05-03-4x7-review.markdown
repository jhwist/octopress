> I stumble over quite a lot of interesting articles and some are worth sharing on this site. I plan to do this every 4 weeks (thus "4x7 Review") and I will include my own posts, some training highlights and some of my nutrition. Enjoy!

## Notable past training

## Upcoming training

## Food consumed
I won't bore you with everything I ate during the past four weeks, but there is always a meal or two that was special.

* [flank steak BBQ](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/grilled_marinated_flank_steak/) {% imgcap %}
* [Greek Meatza](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/greek-meatza-with-creamy-feta-kalamata-olives-and-red-onion/), very easy to prepare, delicious and low-carb

## Found elsewhere
Lastly, a more or less uncommented link-dump of the past 28 days.

* [Getting the callstack of a running ruby process](http://rrn.dk/running-ruby-process-callstack)
* And some more coding: [5 useful tips for a better commit message](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/48933156625/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message) by the fine folks of Thoughbot.
* A nice piece on getting things started: [The McDonald's Theorem](https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/9216e1c9da7d)
* Joe Friel put up sort of a landing page around the topic of [Tapering and Peaking](http://www.joefrielsblog.com/2013/04/tapering-and-peaking-review.html)
* If I read the abstract of this [Foot Strike Patterns](http://journals.humankinetics.com/ijspp-current-issue/ijspp-volume-8-issue-3-may/foot-strike-pattern-and-performance-in-a-marathon) paper correctly it seems that forefoot striking can yield higher performance
* Read this piece about the [people who watch marathons](http://jezebel.com/the-people-who-watch-marathons-473405924) just after the Boston Marathon attack. "If anyone thought this attack would discourage the runners or the watchers, they've clearly never been to a marathon."
* Trainingpeaks (a software that I use and love) is named [official training software of IRONMAN}(http://blog.trainingpeaks.com/posts/2013/5/1/trainingpeaks-named-official-training-software-of-ironman.html)
