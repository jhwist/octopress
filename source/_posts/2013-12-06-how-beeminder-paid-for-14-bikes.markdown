> For almost a year now I'm a happy Beeminder user. It helps me accomplish goals that I otherwise probably would not achieve, like doing a short daily workout, practicing some Spanish, or even keeping my blog alive with content.

## About Dogfood ##
Let me give you a little background information.
What I love about Beeminder is their extensive believe in dog food. Not in the literal sense, but in the sense of product development, where you use your own product (in production, no less) from a very early point during development on. Beeminder has taken that to the next level, because they use Beeminder to improve the product. There is a [meta beeminder goal](https://beeminder/meta/uvi) where the team promises to implement and roll out (and tweet about it!) one "User Visible Improvement" every day. Should they fall off the wagon (derail, in Beeminder terms) the pledge goes to a lucky blog reader (or commenter, respectively). With this scheme, the team managed over [1000](http://blog.beeminder.com/uvi/) UVIs over the last three years! Pretty awesome, if you ask me. In the process though, due to some derailments, the pledge slowly grew to 1000$. And yes, all previous pledges were paid to a Beeminder blog reader.

## Close, but no cigar ##
So, the UVI pledge looms at 1000$. Believe me or not, but I have far better things to do than checking the UVI chart on a daily basis. Alas, once in a while, after checking that my charts are all green, I wander over to the Meta goals. November 19th was such a day, and lo and behold, the team was very close to derailing, which I noticed shortly before going to bed. As time zones happens, the deadline (midnight PT) is a convenient 9am for me, so I set the alarm for the next day to check the goal again, only to find out that they managed to get an UVI rolled out and tweeted about. After a quick exchange on Twitter I went on with my day and more or less forgot about it. And for the coming days the Beeminder team managed to stay on the road, all the way up to 1000 UVIs and more.

On December 3rd, way after 9am (CET) I came across the UVI meta goal again, and to my surprise it was off the road, and to my further surprise, no one had noticed or claimed it by commenting on the blog post.  Which I did, immediately. And Daniel responded pretty quickly, saying that it seemed to be legit, even though they actually has an UVI rolled out, just not tweeted about it in time.


## Holy Moly, they just paid me $1k ##
To be honest, after reading Daniel's comment, I wasn't 100% sure that I'd actually get paid by Beeminder. But I had other things going on (work being one of them) and it was night time at Beeminder HQ anyways. Turns out, when I was asleep the next night, Daniel contacted me on pretty much all available channels to figure out how to pay me. A few emails back and forth in the morning I received the confirmation from PayPal that I had a payment of $1000 in my account. Wow.

## Own vs. Earn ##
What to do with a windfall of $960 (yes, some $40 where lost due to PayPal's transaction fees), shortly before Christmas? There are a couple of gadgets I've been eyeing for the last few months. The Garmin FR620, for one, coming in at $400. A GoPro Hero 3, another $400. That would still leave me with more than $150 to spend. But somehow that didn't feel right. If I own gadgets, I want to have earned them, knowing that I worked for it.

Then, how about getting rid of that slight overdraft, that crept up over the summer? That would make me reach my "Pay back overdraft" Beeminder goal pretty quickly. Still, feels wrong.

Honestly, these two thoughts on how to spend the money went as quickly as they entered my head. I knew what I'd do with the money even before I posted my comment on the Beeminder blog.

## World Bicycle Relief ##

The thing is, it's Holiday Season, and that is the time to give. Probably not very coincidental, the well known [Fat Cyclist](http://www.fatcyclist.com/) has a fundraiser for the World Bicycle Relief going. This is one of the charities that I give money to on a regular basis (and have already done this year for [Fatty's Grand Slam for Zambia 5](http://www.fatcyclist.com/2013/11/30/grand-slam-for-zambia-the-power-of-5/). 

To cut a long story short, I made a donation of $938 for the WBR, thus giving seven bicycles to the people in Zambia, courtesy of Beeminder. However, since this counts towards the "Grand Slam", Fatty's anonymous donor will match those seven bicycles and make it 14. Here's the confirmation email:

> Dear Henrik,

> On behalf of World Bicycle Relief and the people we serve, please accept my sincere appreciation for your generous donation of $938.00.

> World Bicycle Relief’s mission is to provide access to independence and livelihood through the Power of Bicycles; your gift helps mobilize people across rural Sub-Saharan Africa with simple, sustainable bicycle transportation. Your generosity helps connect children with schools, healthcare workers with patients and entrepreneurs with markets.

> Thank you for sharing The Power of Bicycles!

> F.K. Day,
> President, Co-Founder, World Bicycle Relief

Now, should I, by any chance, win one of the bikes that Fatty organised as an incentive for his fundraiser, I'm totally going to keep it.

I would like to thank the Beeminder team for an awesome product and there courage to live up to their slip-ups each and every time.
