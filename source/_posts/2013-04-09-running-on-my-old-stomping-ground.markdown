> One of my recent long runs led me through a forest where I spent a lot of time training when I was younger. In lieu of a proper About page, I'll tell you where I come from.

I've always been involved in some kind of sports activity as long as I can remember, albeit never really successful by any means. Starting with the inevitable soccer career (about a year) I quickly changed to swimming.
