Since starting to run again in late 2010 I only had very few opportunities to
run shorter races (less than 10km). There is a local [charity race](http://212.202.252.173/oekumene-laeuft/)
which offers a 5km and 10km distance. While I've run the 10km twice already, I
don't consider this to be a good race for a PR attempt, as

 * it is not chip timed
 * is measured notoriously short (the 10km ends up being 9.6km usually)

Then there is the [B2Run](http://www.b2run.de/muenchen/) every year, but that is
an odd 6.3km and you have to line up really early to be able to run fast, otherwise
it's just too crowded. This year I didn't even bother to register.

As as the running season is winding down, I thought about my options. The local
charity race was out of question (going to pace my 9yo for his first 5k, though), so 
what's one to do? I'll be flying to Baltimore, MD in two weeks to visit a good friend
and watch some football. Following an intuition I googled "Baltimore 5k October 12"
and it turns out there is the [Baltimore Running Festival](http://www.thebaltimoremarathon.com/Race_Info/fila22d8.htm)
on Saturday, October 12th, that offers a 5k run. Could I really be that lucky?

Ugh, crazy early start (8.15am), but yeah, that's doable, the starting line
is right around the corner from my hotel and I'll probably be awake early anyway
due to jet-lag. Check &#x2713;.

Ugh, packet pickup only at the Expo the night before. That could be a deal breaker.
But wait, the Expo is open till 9pm. My flight comes in before 7pm, it seems to be
only about 25 minutes from the airport to downtown Baltimore. Close, but I can make
that. Check &#x2713;.

Let's sign up for the 5k then. Ugh. It's sold out, there is a waiting list. Definitely
a deal breaker.

However, my brain was already sold on running in Baltimore on October 12th. After
some more pondering and planning, I registered for the half-marathon. So unless my
plane comes in crazy late on Friday I'll run another half-marathon this season.
