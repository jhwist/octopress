## As seen on runbikeco.de

 * [A Miami-Beach Runaround](/blog/2013/11/20/a-miami-beach-runaround/)

## Notable past training
I took almost two weeks off after the [Baltimore half-marathon](/blog/2013/10/21/race-report-baltimore-running-festival-half-marathon/)
in order to recover and refresh. I then slowly eased back into training with a
bit of cross-training (mostly weights and some cycling in the gym), before going
for my first run of this training cycle, a whopping 6km on November 4th. Since
then, I slowly (remember the good old 10% rule?) increased my weekly mileage and
my long-run mileage. This week, I'll end up with 32km and the first two digit long
run (10km, planned for this Sunday).

For November, I ran 100.5km (for comparison, November 2012 had me at 23km).

## Upcoming training
I'll continue this base training period until right before the week of Christmas,
making it a nice 7 week period, followed by one easy week during the holidays.
After that, I scheduled three 4-week blocks with one week recovery in between,
which, after a two week taper, leads me to the Vienna City Half-Marathon on
April 13, 2014.

## Found elsewhere
Lastly, a more or less uncommented link-dump of the past 28 days.
