## Pre Race: Getting there ##


## Pre Race: Packet pick up & Expo ## 

## Race morning ##

 * wake up at 6.30 (jet lag helps with that)
 * breakfast at 7, eggs, bacon, fruits and yoghurt
 * back to the room, watch the marathon start on TV and dress up
* out to the starting line at 8.30, way too early as it turns out. corrals empty, everything relaxed
 * 20 minutes warmup run along the marathon course, cheering on the first marathoners


## The Race

  * first corral, 2000 runners each with 3 minutes 
 * first n miles alone, then merge mile
 * lots of hills on the first part of the race but also nice downhill stretches. no water stops as usual.
 * last 3 miles pretty much all downhill. 
 * pull to the finish line with almost 4'/km
 
## Finish Area ##
 * tons of volunteers, all super efficient, handing out water, blankets and finisher medals
 * great food options

## Random Notes ##
 * got complimented a lot about my smiling, usually resulting in extra cheers. It was hard to not smile today
 * cool signs: may the course be with you. chuck Norris never ran a marathon
