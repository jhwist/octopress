## To train or to race? ##
Enter coach and his plan. The plan for July 14th was to do a long run of 22km. After
relating the fact that I'd like to do a race instead{% fn_ref 2 %} we quickly
came to the conclusion that a half marathon at race pace would be too intense,
but the long run still should be happening. So a 10.3km race followed by an easy
10km cool-down was called for.

## The race ##
Go for a run and do something good at the same time. That's the idea of the
[Run 4 Trees](http://www.run4trees.de), where the race fees get equally
distributed for the [Plant for the planet](http://www.plant-for-the-planet.org/en/) organization
as well as the youth section of the local sport club. As the race took place
close to where I live, I dressed in running clothes, packed some food and water
and road my bike to the start area.

A total of 294 runners lined up for the race (161 starters for the 10.3km, 133 for
the half marathon). Weather was nice, blue sky and warm air and after a 2km warm-up
I was ready to race.

Despite being a chip timed race I lined up pretty far at the front to avoid the
usual dodge and weave through slower runners. From my recon run the week before
I knew that the first kilometer would be on a narrow path and I wanted to have
as much room as possible right from the beginning.

The gun went off and the field sped away, 10km runners and half marathoners alike.

As the half marathon basically consisted of two loops of the 10.3km race (plus
some extra) I had a nice mental guessing game whether someone I passed (or
or who passed me) would be a 10.3km contender or "just" a half marathoner. Quite
entertaining...

After the first kilometer on pavement the course broke off into a large loop trough a
forest on a nice gravel trail before coming back the same paved road. Before
turning into the forest there was a highway underpass and at the end of that, before
going up again, a samba band. They used the underpass tunnel as a natural amplifier
and got us all pumped up. Kudos to them for sticking (drumming?) around long enough
for the third and fourth pass by the half marathoners!

The run itself was uneventful. I was able to run a good solid 4'15"-4'20" pace, skipping
the water stations. At kilometer 5 I was slowly passed by another runner (second or third place
of the half marathon, as I would later find out) and managed to tag along until kilometer 7,
resulting in a 4'13" and 4'04" split for the next two kilometers.

I had a small group of
runners about 25m-50m in front of me, but never really managed to close the gap myself.
Only when approaching the 9 kilometer mark with the highway underpass I was able to catch
them on the ensuing ascend and run with them for the last kilometer, only to
find out that they'd all run the half marathon. No competitors for me, but good
company for the last kilometer. I was passed by a runner pushing a stroller (!) on
the last few hundred meters. Turns out, he'd be my age group and finish 51 seconds
ahead of me (obviously started behind me, judging from the result list).

## The training run ##

After stopping for a short while to catch my breath, get something to drink and
to take of my chip and bib number (didn't want to confuse other runners more than
necessary) I entered the course again. This time I went counter-clockwise, figuring
I'd be able to cheer for oncoming runners. My legs felt super-heavy initially
but I soon found a good rhythm, running a 6'10"/km pace. I saw a couple of half marathoners
twice (at the end of their first round and then again on their second loop) and
cheered for them whenever I saw an opportunity (some ran with ear buds, no point
in shouting encouragements their way). Sadly, when I finished my second loop, the
samba band was gone already.


## The result ##
After finishing my rather long cool-down run, I was eager to see the result list.
Turns out I missed third place in my age group by one(!) second, coming in at 11th overall
and 4th AG with a time of [43'40"](http://www.sas-online.net/sas_online_stats/ergebnisliste.php?eventID=205&lng=EN).
According to my Garmin I ran the 10km in 42'15", an unofficial PR by 1'09".

I'm still very happy with the result as I rather run for PRs than for place, even
though I might have to think about placing in my AG as being possible in the near future.

For your amusement, here's how it went down on Strava:
