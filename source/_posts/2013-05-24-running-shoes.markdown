> After getting blisters more often than not when running in my beloved Nike Free shoes I looked at their mileage ... lo and behold, they seemed to be past prime time. With some new shoes in the house, this serves as a good opportunity to give you an overview of past and current choices.

I am of firm belief that every runner needs to find their own best fit when it comes to shoes. While it is easy to recommend technical items like running watches, fuel belts, etc., shoes just don't work this way. So please, look at this as a list of shoes I've tried. If some of the pros and cons I list for a shoe ring a bell, by all means go to a good shop and try them on, but don't blame me if you can't run with them. You have been warned. Also, for your convenience I've added links to Amazon.com and Amazon.de in case you want to buy online. Those are affiliate links, see the note at the end of this post.

With that, let's start with the early days.

## Asics Cumulus 12 ##
This is the shoe that carried me through the first two years of my running comeback. I bought these in the beginning of 2010 after deciding to [get back to running](/blog/...). I went to a local sportshop and was helped by a friendly clerk, who asked me about my running volume (not much at that time), preferences to trail or street (mostly street, as is still the case) and any potential orthopedic issues (told him about my lingering knee problems). He came back with two models, one of which being the Asics Cumulus 12 (can't remember the other one). Back in my triathlon days I had Asics as well, so I tried the Cumulus first, went onto the treadmill for a few steps (including videotaping said steps) and loved the shoe. Sold.

Mind you, I was still a heel-striker back then. So what's to like about the Cumulus 12? I found it to be very stable and comfortable while at the same time light enough considering the amount of cushion it has.
