I am of firm belief that every runner needs to find their own best fit when it
comes to shoes. While it is easy to recommend technical items like running
watches, fuel belts, etc., shoes just don't work this way. So please, look at
this as a list of shoes I've tried. If some of the pros and cons I list for a
shoe ring a bell, by all means go to a good shop and try them on, but don't
blame me if you can't run with them. You have been warned. Also, for your
convenience I've added links to Amazon.com and Amazon.de in case you want to
buy online. Those are affiliate links, see the note at the end of this post.

With that, let's start with the early days.

## Asics Cumulus 12 ##
This is the shoe that carried me through the first two years of my running
comeback. I bought these in the beginning of 2010 after deciding to [get back
to running](/blog/2013/04/09/running-on-my-old-stomping-ground/). I went to a
local sport shop and was helped by a friendly clerk, who asked me about my
running volume (not much at that time),
preferences to trail or street (mostly street, as is still the case)
and any potential orthopedic issues (told him about my lingering knee
problems). He came back with two models, one of which being the 
[ASICS] (http://www.asicsamerica.com/)
Cumulus 12 (can't remember the other one). Back in my triathlon days I had
ASICS as well, so I tried the Cumulus first, went onto the treadmill for a
few steps (including videotaping said steps) and loved the shoe. Sold.

Mind you, I was still a heel-striker back then. So what's to like about the
Cumulus 12? I found it to be very stable and comfortable while at the same time
light enough considering the amount of cushion it has. Also, it is a really 
durable shoe; I've had it for over two years and it didn't wear in any unusual 
way. Of course, once I tried to run with a forefoot strike, I noticed that
the stability, especially in the front, got into the way and I needed something
more flexible. So, if you're not a heel striker, don't go for this shoe.

## Nike Free 3.0 ##
{% imgcap http://assets.runbikeco.de/shoes-nike-overview.jpg Nike Free 3.0 %}

This shoe carried me through most of 2011 and 2012. After transitioning to a forefoot
strike I noticed that me feet, especially my toes, needed more flexibility to "feel" 
the ground. So off I went again to buy new shoes. There wasn't much choice for "natural"
running shoes (and I didn't know a lot about it, either), but thankfully the clerk
showed me the Nike Free 3.0. Ahh, what a revelation. I tried them on the treadmill
and knew that these shoes would support my new stride. 

*What's to like?* The Nike Free 3.0 is super flexible, especially in the front. You can 
easily bend the front of the shoe all the way back. It also has very little drop towards
the back, which helped me to concentrate on a forefoot landing. And, thanks to the light
mesh, the toes have a lot of wiggle room. Feels odd at first, but I soon started to feel
confined in the ASICS in comparison. 

*What's not to like?* Well, I often felt like wearing a fashion statement rather than 
true running shoes. The design is in my opinion not very running like and this fact
isn't helped by their shape. Another thing I noticed during winter training is that
the structure of the soles are prone to collect gravel. The occasional stone caught 
in a slot of the sole isn't noticeable, but I've had runs where I felt the amount of
gravel through the sole and so had to clean the shoes before the next run.

## Adidas Adipure Trainer 360 ##
After saying goodbye to the ASICS, I figured I needed a new pair of shoes to spread the 
load and have some shoe rotation going on again. This time I new what to ask for in the shop
and tried several different pairs of minimal running shoes. The Adipure Tr360 wasn't my first
choice, but - for whatever reason - all the others didn't feel right (amongst them the very
same Merrell Flux Glove that I bought in May this year).

*What's to like?*

*What's not to like?* Wet feet. These shoes are for dry streets only, or else: wet feet. 
See, part of the flexibility of this shoe comes from the special design of the sole, 
which has gaps in it. These gaps however have no protection towards the inner mesh. Therefore,
one step into a puddle, or snow, or some other wet road and you can immediately feel your socks
get wet.

On hindsight, this shoe is also the heaviest of my three current pairs (464g), but I didn't know that
when I bought them. All in all, the Adidas will probably be the least used shoe in the rotation,
since I won't be running fast or long runs with it (too heavy on the feet), nor will I run
on wet streets with it (and wet streets we have a lot, this year).
