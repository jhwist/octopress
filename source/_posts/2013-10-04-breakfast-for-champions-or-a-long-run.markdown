## LCHwhat? ##

If you [recall](/blog/2013/04/09/running-on-my-old-stomping-ground/), my initial
reason to get back onto the bike was _drumroll_ weight-loss, like for so many
others. Since then, my focus shifted from losing weight to performing well in races.
For both goals, nutrition is obviously key (you simply cannot out-train a bad
diet, and you cannot perform well with a bad diet, either).

Through various channels I came to try the Low-Carb-High-Fat (hence: LCHF) diet.
I am not religious about it, and there is no one true LCHF (I lean mostly
towards a [Paleo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet) lifestyle), but
it works for me and I feel good about/with it.

In essence, I don't eat processed food (no energy gels, thankyouverymuch), grains
(therefore no pasta, oat-meal, etc.), but do eat a lot of eggs, meat, fruit and vegetables.
These days, my body essentially runs on fat and proteins with a very minimal amount
of carbohydrates.

My usual breakfast consists of scrambled eggs with various additions and fresh
fruit. This gets me going well until lunchtime, unless I have planned a major
sports activity before noon - such as a long run or a morning race. I've noticed
that for anything up to an hour I'm good to go without additional food, but I'm
likely to get hungry for any activity longer or later than that.

## Pimp my Breakfast ##

Here is my tried and true addition for the extra bit of fuel. As I was searching
for an oatmeal/porridge replacement I came across [Quinoa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinoa).
It's a grain-like crop but does not belong to the family of grains. It's not
exactly low-carb, either but for what it's worth I'll burn those calories quite
easily, and Quinoa adds a ton (not the literal one) of protein. Granted,
initially the taste doesn't appeal to everyone, but there are ways to make
it taste good (or you'll get used to it).

The Nutrition Facts to the right where pulled from [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=quinoa+nutrion+facts),
but please note that I'm not a registered dietitian nor a health-care professional,
so please do your own research!

  
Here's what I need to prepare Quinoa for my breakfast:

  * 1/4 cup of uncooked Quinoa
  * 1/4 cup of water
  * 1/4 cup of milk
  * 1/2 apple, diced
  * cinnamon, cardamon, vanilla and/or other spices to taste
  * optional: 1 tbsp flax seeds
  * optional: 1 tbsp flax meal

In a small pot, add Quinoa and water and bring it to boil. Turn the heat on low
and let it simmer for about 7-10 minutes (careful: check that not all of the water
evaporates, otherwise you'll burn your meal). Now add spices and milk, stir well and
let it cook for another 5 minutes on medium. The meal is ready when it's not visibly
liquid anymore. It should now have a porridge-like texture. If it's still too moist
just let it sit for a couple of minutes. Put the diced apple into a bowl and add
the (still warm) Quinoa meal.

You can further enhance the taste as well as the nutritional value by adding flax seeds
and/or flax meal before adding the milk, depending on your preference for the texture (if you add both flax
seeds and -meal the texture tends to be a bit on the slimy side, you have been
warned!). If you add both, you'll end up with another ~7g of fat, ~5g of carbohydrates
and 3.5g of proteins.

Total prep-time: less than 15 minutes.

## Reasons to like it ##

 1. It's quick and easy to prepare. I have prepared this at 6am in the morning on a
 camping stove.
 2. It brings a lot of (good) calories for a small amount of food. Therefore:
 3. It's easily digestible and (at least for me) stomach friendly.
 4. It helps with your hydration, because it stores quite a bit of water.

## Reasons to dislike it ##

 1. The taste: Try different spices or different fruit additions!
 2. The texture: This one is tricky, but play around with cooking times and/or
 the mix of ingredients, especially with the flax.
 3. Not low-carb enough: Well then, Quinoa might not be for you.

I have successfully completed two half-marathons and a bunch of Sunday long-runs
with not much else in the stomach and have never bonked. Works for me!
