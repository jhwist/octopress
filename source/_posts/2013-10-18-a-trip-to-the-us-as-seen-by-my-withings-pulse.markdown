The idea for this post occurred to me as an afterthought while looking at last
week's data on my Withings dashboard. The data of a regular work week is pretty boring,
whereas this five day trip to Baltimore, MD, actually stood out quite visibly.
Digging deeper I was able to relive all major events of the trip, which I'm going
to share with you.

> A note on the graphs: All times are CET, and one bar represents 30 minutes.

## Day One - Friday, October 11, 2013: Travel Day ##
This day starts at home in Munich with the usual wake up at 5.45am and continues well into
the next day due to the timezone change (see below). I left the house shortly
after 8am, walked to the train station and made my way to the airport. Once
there, I'd do the check-in/security dance and since that took less time than
anticipated I got to spend an hour in the lounge. When boarding time came
around, I walked the long walk to the gate and boarded immediately (no time
lost there). Next up comes the 8 hours long flight to Philadelphia, PA.

I took a nap of about 2.5 hours after lunch in order to not crash early on the
other side of the flight, as I still had to do the race-packet pickup. You can
see the nap when looking at the same day from a sleep perspective:

## Day Two - Saturday, October 12, 2013: Race Day ##
The Withings Dashboard doesn't account for timezone changes, but as you will see
I'm still on *Friday* at the beginning of this graph. Yep, you can make out
the short hop from Philadelphia to Baltimore, followed by a lot of walking from the airport
to my hotel in downtown Baltimore, then to the Convention Center for packet pickup
and finally it all ends little walking while grabbing some food in the hotel.

{% imgcap http://assets.runbikeco.de/withings-activity-20131012.png Lots of walking. %}

What follows next is a good solid 7 hours of sleep, only shortly woken by some
jet lag effects. Thankfully I didn't have a lot of trouble getting back to sleep
and I actually had to be woken up by my alarm at 6.30am (EDT).

{% imgcap http://assets.runbikeco.de/withings-sleep-20131012.png More sleep than I expected. %}

Looking back at the day above you can spot my breakfast "activity" and then a long pause.
I got myself ready for the race around 8am and left the Pulse on my pants. In hindsight
I should have put it somewhere on my race shorts, as there would be a big red chunk
of activity in between 8.30am and 10.30am. Instead all you can see is a flat line.
But I went back to the hotel after the race, showered and changed back into my
regular clothes before making my way back to the celebration village.

The rest of the day was spent meandering around, eating all the food and later on
picking up my friend and going to his cousin's place where we were allowed to crash
for the next two nights.

## Day Three - Sunday, October 13, 2013: Football Day ##

Again, this "day" starts with the rest of the previous night, where you can see
us hanging out on the couch chatting, then going out for dinner, sitting at
said dinner place and later going home again.

Fast forward a good 8 hours of sleep and it's **Game Day**. Of course the day
starts off with having breakfast and then a nice walk to the stadium (no need
for a car when the stadium is right downtown). Of course, not much walking
around during the game. For the record, the Ravens [lost](http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2013101300/2013/REG6/packers@raven)
their home game to the Packers.

{% imgcap http://assets.runbikeco.de/withings-activity-20131013.png The game was more exciting than it looks here. %}

After the game we walked to the nearest bar that featured a TV and - guess what -
watched some more football (albeit not the whole game as the bar became pretty crowded).

Since we didn't want to stay for the rest of the game we made our way home and watched
the rest of Sunday's football games, because that's how we roll.

## Day Four - Monday, October 14, 2013: Sightseeing and Travel Day ##

This day was spent with a good mixture of walking (schlepping my carry-on with me,
except that the Pulse didn't take notice of it) to various sites in downtown Baltimore
and a lot of coffee- and lunch-breaks. I was even able to soak up some sunshine
sitting at the inner harbour and reading.

{% imgcap http://assets.runbikeco.de/withings-activity-20131014.png Oops. Some action going on. %}

At the end of the graph above you can see the flight from BWI to PHL. And if you've
ever made that flight yourself, you can see that this inactivity is longer than
it should have been (airtime for this segment is usually around 20 minutes). Yes, we
left Baltimore about half an hour late. Which brought my connection awfully close to
being a missed connection. Despite having run a half marathon the day before, I did
a sprint from Terminal A1 to A25 in Philadelphia (cnt.).

## Day Five - Tuesday, October 15, 2013: Travel and Home Day ##

Yep, I had to go on an all-out sprint to the terminal and made it with zero
minutes to spare - the gate agent closed the doors right behind my back.

{% imgcap http://assets.runbikeco.de/withings-activity-20131015.png Run. Fly. Walk. %}

The flight back to Munich was really uneventful and I was even able to get five
hours of sleep on the plane. The rest of the day was spent unpacking and getting
back into a CET-based routine. I was able to stay awake until 10.30pm which made
adjusting to the home timezone during the next day(s) a lot easier.

## The Big Picture ##

Here's an overview of all days with sleep being represented in blue color and
activity represented in red. In this picture it's easier to see the time zone
difference (-6 hours) as well as the strange sleep patterns on the plane.

{% imgcap http://assets.runbikeco.de/withings-activity-overview.png All times are CET. Trip starts on Friday. %}

It's really a pity though that the bright red spots of the half marathon are missing.
