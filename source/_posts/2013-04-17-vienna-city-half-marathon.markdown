### Friday: Travel to Vienna ###
Part of the reason to run in Vienna was that apparently it has one of the nicest city
courses in Europe. Another - even more important - part was that we have friends living
there who would be happy to host us for the weekend. So on Friday afternoon
after school we headed out of Munich by train, dragging quite some luggage (two
suitcases, one backpack and my Nike bag with the running gear).

A mere four hours later we arrived in Vienna and transferred via the two short underground rides
to our friends' place, right in the heart of Vienna and very close to the marathon route. 
It really doesn't get any better than that, so thank you, Susanne, Gerhard, Vincent and Konrad!

After a delicious dinner (Steak and salad, no carbs, thankyouverymuch) we stayed up way too long
drinking whine and catching up with old and new news. A good time was had by all.

### Saturday: Race Expo ###


### Sunday: The Race ###
Being situated so close to the race course I decided I would make my way to the starting line by foot,
taking the opportunity to get some warm-up along the way. Since I had my personal support crew I didn't even
have to drop off a bag and so I just grabbed my Garmin FR610 and headed out. The weather was beautiful, blue
sky and warm enough so that no jacket was needed (another problem disappeared).
The only downside of this was that I had trained at much lower temperatures all winter and wasn't quite sure 
how I would be able to cope with 20&deg; Celsius. At least I made the right choice in regards to clothing,
knee long running tight and short sleeve shirt.

On my way to the starting line crossing the Reichsbr&uuml;cke I passed some fast guys:

_The future winners?_

It seemed most of the runners went to the start by underground transportation, approaching the corrals from the 
back/side. I was quite happy to be able to just pass over the bridge and roll up the field from the front. Much less
crowded plus I got enough room to warm up! After the usual portapotty dance I noticed that the different starting
corrals where not controlled at all and that the yellow one (the third corral) was still half empty despite it being
T-20 minutes to the start. So I jumped the small fence and walked towards the front of the corral as far possible.
While I felt bad about my bib clearly showing my wrong-being I figured it would
be ok (others did the same, no-one really cared) and in hindsight it was a good
choice; there where still a lot of runners in front of me that I would have to pass. Judging one's racing ability seems
to be hard for some people.

After just a little standing while (announcements, welcoming [Haile Gebrselassie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haile_Gebrselassie),
and the Austrian national anthem) the gun went off and the crowed got moving. 41000 runners set off to run
either the marathon, the half or a marathon relay.

As per my [Race Plan](/blog/2013-04-11-strategy-for-a-half-marathon/) I started very conservatively,
hitting a 5'15" per km for the first three kilometer more or less exactly. I quickly noticed that I'd have
a hard time running my own pace as there was a lot of passing, accelerating, stopping and detouring going on.
Nevertheless I tried to push the pace from kilometer 5 onwards, aiming for a 5' pace or below. I knew I wouldn't 
need any nutrition for this distance so I sped through the water stations as quickly as possible{% fn_ref 1 %}.

At kilometer 9 I noticed one of the pace guys and as I got closer I realized he was carrying the "1:45 HM finish time"
banner. I tried to hang onto him which was challenge more due to high traffic than due to pace. At kilometer 11 I 
was able to pass the pace runner and things improved from then on out - at least traffic wise.




### Lessons learned ###
* Don't wear freshly washed socks for a race
* Two weeks off of running are no good
* Not having a good pace line will result in a lot of extra distance, about 400 meters in my case

### Event Retrospect ###
* too many runners, water ran out, not enough finisher medals
* plastic cups are no fun to run over
* FinisherPix is slow

  {% fn %} the amount of runners going abruptly from their pace line in the middle to either
  side of the street surprised me more than once.
