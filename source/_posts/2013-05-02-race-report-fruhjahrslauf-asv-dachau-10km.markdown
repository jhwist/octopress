See, when I did my [trip down the memory lane](/blog/2013/04/09/running-on-my-old-stomping-ground/) I found this gem:

This is, as far as I can recollect, my all-time PR over 10km: 0h 45'18", way back
when I still did triathlons. In 2011 I ran a 48'50" at a local charity race and in
2012 I managed to do the same charity race in 46'03". Close to my PR from September 1991, 
but still almost a minute off.

Until May 1st, 2013. A few weeks ago I registered for the Spring race in Dachau, north of Munich.
This is a small race, less than 300 participants on the 10km and a really flat course. The weather
presented itself with an overcast sky (typical for the region north of Munich) and temperatures around
18&deg; Celsius - perfect running conditions.

Having done some interval training for the recent Half Marathon I wanted to find out how long
I can keep my threshold tempo. I lined up right at the front of the pack, knowing that I would 
get passed a lot in the beginning. When the gun went off the fast guys where gone immediately (the
later winner would finish in 34'07", close to a 3'24"/km pace), but I found a group of 4'-4'15"/km
runners and set out to hang onto them as long as possible.

I was really surprised by a 5km split of 21'15", averaging 04'15", and my legs felt still reasonably well.
The only thing that started to bother me - again - where blisters developing on both big toes. But that's
the beauty of a 10km race, you can basically power through everything, especially after the 5km mark.

Ignoring my feet I pushed on, tried to get a good draft for a short headwind section and kept the tempo
as high as possible. On the last 3-4km I noticed that my pace dropped towards 4'25"/km but I knew I could
keep that pace until the end and it would still be an awesome time.

The [official](http://www.asv-dachau.de/fileadmin/user_upload/benutzer/leichtathletik/fjl13.html) time 
was 43'24", finishing 83rd out of 254 male starters, 11th in my age group.
