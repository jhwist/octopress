> I stumble over quite a lot of interesting articles and some are worth sharing on this site. I plan to do this every 4 weeks (thus "4x7 Review") and I will include my own posts, some training highlights and some of my nutrition. Enjoy!

## As seen on runbikeco.de ##
Can you tell that the weather was really, really nice for the most part of July and August? Yep, not much blogging happened, and I blame summer! But still, if you want to recap:

  * My first post about coding (yep, the co.de part of this whole thing): [A Simple Data Logger](blog/2013/08/07/a-simple-data-logger/)
  * Race Report [Run 4 Trees](/blog/2013/07/30/race-report-run-4-trees/)

## Notable past training

## Upcoming training

## Food consumed
I won't bore you with everything I ate during the past four weeks, but there is always a meal or two that was special.
  
  * Self-made Pizza from the Grill. Again forgot to take pictures. The pizza was better than my last attempt, I think I have the dough figured out by now. Things to work on: How to transfer the pizza from "production" to the grill without ripping it apart.
  * Mostly lots of BBQ. Can you spot a scheme here?
  * Feed Zone Portables.

## Found elsewhere
Lastly, a more or less uncommented link-dump of the past 28 days.

 * Where do [muscles get there power](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130712102844.htm)?
 * Treating [harmstring strains](http://www.kinetic-revolution.com/hamstring-strains/). I can understand my injury from earlier this year better now.
 * PowerTap announces [price drop](http://velonews.competitor.com/2013/08/bikes-and-tech/powertap-drops-power-meter-hub-price-by-510_297666) for the G3 hub. Awesome stuff!
 * [A Saturday on Strava, Mapped](http://engineering.strava.com/saturday-heatmap/).
