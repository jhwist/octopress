  <p>Hi, my name is Henrik. I'm a Software Guy by trade and recently (in 2010) started to ride my 
  <a href="/blog/categories/riding">bike</a> again. 
  And then winter came along and I wanted to stay fit. Therefore I started to <a href="/blog/categories/running">run</a>
  again.
  </p>
  <p>
  While riding or running I let my mind wander and noticed a desire to write stuff down. That's what this blog
  is for. I hope I can provide amusing stories, sprinkled with some useful information and the occasional
  product recommendation.
  </p>
  <p>My other passion is writing code. Even if I don't have nearly as much opportunity to write code every day
  due to my management-style position, I still need a place to write about my findings and code-adventures. That
  would be the <a href="/blog/categories/coding/">co.de</a> part of the blog.
  </p>
  For a somewhat longer story as to why I "started" running and riding again, I recommend to 
  read my <a href="/blog/2013/04/09/running-on-my-old-stomping-ground/">introduction.</a>
